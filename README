Android library project for sending SMS on all available devices.

You use the library just like the SmsManager in Android and it will automatically pick the correct implementation based on the device, including the following:

1. Using android.telephony.gsm.SmsManager on Cupcake (1.5) and earlier versions of Android
2. Using android.telephony.SmsManager on Donut (1.6) and later versions of Android
3. A work-around to prevent double messages on HTC Tattoo
4. A work-around to prevent double messages on Samsung Galaxy S2 with ICS 4.0.3 (see http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=27024)

Example usage:

    private CompatibilitySmsManager mSmsManager = CompatibilitySmsManager.getDefault();
    ...
        mSmsManager.sendTextMessage(phoneNumber, null, message, null, null);
    
See also the Android documentation at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/SmsManager.html.

Dont forget to add the required permission to your manifest file.

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SEND_SMS" />
